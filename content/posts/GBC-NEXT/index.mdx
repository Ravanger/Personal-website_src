Tasked with designing and developing a multi-user portfolio website for graduating students to showcase their work.
Responsible for the following:

- Setting up a public Linux web server
- Setting up a WordPress installation
- Setting up a front-end publishing system in WordPress
- Implementing features from design
- Styling to fit design

For this project, I chose WordPress as the starting point. Students from different programs are able to upload their work to showcase to the public.
Users of the website can search for and filter out different student works and students, as well as browse works by program.
